        lived in the neighborhood of Rocha Miranda. His father taught him values ​​such as: "speaking the truth". Your
        mother, who died in July 2013 of throat cancer, never tired of glorifying God, which marked
        your faith in God even deeper. At the age of 11, when writing his first essay
        in less than 15 minutes (time given by the teacher in the 5th grade), she narrated a fictional story, earning
        a scholarship from the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, whose proposal was to train writers. Had by prof.

		she asked Him to grant her to be his writer. She said, “Little messages, God. Who knows
		may be placed in the Church bulletin...” (Our Pastor encouraged us to write for this bulletin).
		In what God immediately answered him, that that space, He did not grant him, because it was for
		the Pastor to complete his messages to the Church. But, the Lord only does big and deep things
		and it was no different with Wilma Machado. Then came the songs, a story for a music video, a play

			matched their deepest needs. (I am referring to material needs...
			that prayer and fasting should not be dispensed with, essential for the effectiveness of any
			evangelistic work.) I thought... But whose? Where are? I sought the Lord and I believed
			that He led me to see that the Deacon and I did not have this extra that this family needed.
			However... I looked around... It was there the whole time. The neighbors of that family... The community
			- family; the local churches. If you join a little bit here and there... Imagine a community
