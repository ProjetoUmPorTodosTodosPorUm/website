		organizational system of Christian ethical values, have their administrative principles based on
		in the word of God from Genesis to Revelation backed by the gospel of
		<cite>Matthew 25:34–36.</cite>
		Since they are evangelistic in nature, they are authored and administered by the Holy Spirit,
		<cite>John 14:16-17; 16:7-14</cite>
		whose main purpose is to announce the gospel, rebuilding person(s) or family(ies) deprived of the faith
		and of hope; which finds itself in glaring material and spiritual needs.`,

		church and naturally the owner of this Project. It represents leadership, whose roots are
		embedded in the post-reformation Christian line <cite>(Martin Luther)</cite> as well as the “author” acting
		these by means of UNITY and UNION; thus, within a joint action, they rescue principles and
		conduct of a Christian life experienced in <cite>Acts 2:42-47</cite>. Here the whole community can
		and must participate. Here it is God for all and the community for one or more members of its
		community, in the exercise of love according to

        firstParagraph: `After a few months of evangelistic and social work carried out in a certain house by
		me, and Deacon Umaracir da Conceição Ribeiro, an experienced evangelist; I noticed that this
		family needed much more than we were offering. We helped; However, this aid
		matched their deepest needs. (I am referring to material needs...
		that prayer and fasting should not be dispensed with, essential for the effectiveness of any
		evangelistic work.) I thought... But whose? Where are? I sought the Lord and I believed
		that He led me to see that the Deacon and I did not have this extra that this family needed.
		However... I looked around... It was there the whole time. The neighbors of that family... The community
		- family; the local churches. If you join a little bit here and there... Imagine a community
		with 305 homes. If each family commits to offering 01 item (01 food not
		perishable). 01 item per family, not counting extra offers, external support (offers
		from outside residents). Churches cooperating. Just imagine!`,
        secondtParagraph: `I realized then that the success of our work depended on joint action. I started... I returned
		to this family, and I told them about the project, and if we could start this greater support with them, in
		that the community participates through its offers (donations) as a whole. The family received
		thanks for the idea. Then, the registration of the 1st family to be assisted by this well-known Project
		within the Banguense community, Condomínio Ayrton Senna. I wrote down your first data, and
		I immediately proceeded through the nearest houses. Of the families I sought, in that
		evening there was no one who did not want to participate. And why not mention the first three
		Offeror Volunteer families represented respectively:`,
        thirdParagraph: `This method of obtaining resources through proximity to the needy family(ies) is effective
		because if everyone doesn't know her, they will be able to know her (discretely) without having the need to
		get a vehicle for that. <b>
		>Thus, the community exercises its love of neighbor and, seeing the results, grows in faith and in
		love of Christ.</b>`,
